Ender Nexus
============

#### What is it?
Ender Nexus is a Minecraft Forge mod inspired by TeamCoFH's Thermal Expansion's tesseracts.

Ender Nexus adds a block that can transport items, fluids, and forge energy wirelessly between blocks and across dimensions.

Use of a recipe mod such as JEI is recommended, though there is only one block.
Recipe may be subject to change later.
